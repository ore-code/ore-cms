# Overview

Ore DB is a refreshingly simple content management system designed for teams who value clarity, speed, and control. Whether you're a developer building out a site structure or a content editor updating pages, Ore CMS makes collaboration seamless—without the overhead of traditional CMS platforms.

At its core, Ore CMS is a client-side CMS. That means there’s no backend, no database, and no server-side logic. Everything runs in the browser, powered by static files and a few smart conventions. You drop it onto any server that supports rewrite rules, and you're off to the races.
